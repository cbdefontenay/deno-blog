# Deno-Blog
# Personnal blog created with Next.Js

### This blog was created using the new "bÃªta" version of Next.Js.

This version is not using the **page** directory, as always, but the new *app* one
introduced in Next.Js 13.

In this blog we like to talk about **Deno**, because Deno is great, fast and secure. 
Eventually, this blog will also have some other topics, related to Deno, like the Deno *framework*:
**FRESH**.

I also really like Next.Js, and especially its new update (v-13). That's why it's build with Next.Js and not *Fresh*.
